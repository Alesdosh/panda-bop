# Sequential Movement System

## Problem Solved

Previously, users could "cheat" by dragging directly to the end of any path without following the complete trajectory. For example, in a zigzag pattern, users could draw a straight line from start to finish instead of following each zigzag segment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Sequential Progress Validation

The new system enforces **sequential movement** along the path:

- **Maximum Advancement**: Users can only advance 3% of the total path at a time
- **Forward-Only Movement**: Users must follow the path step by step, no jumping ahead
- **Strict Tolerance**: Reduced tolerance (40px) requires more precise following

### 2. New PathManager Methods

#### `getNextValidProgress()`
```typescript
getNextValidProgress(
  cursorX: number, 
  cursorY: number, 
  currentProgress: number, 
  maxAdvancement: number = 0.1,
  tolerance: number = 60
): number | null
```

- Only looks for valid positions **ahead** of current progress
- Limits how far ahead the user can advance
- Returns `null` if no valid forward position is found

#### `isPositionOnPath()`
```typescript
isPositionOnPath(x: number, y: number, progress: number, tolerance: number = 60): boolean
```

- Checks if a specific position is close enough to a specific point on the path
- Used for backward movement validation

### 3. Enhanced Movement Logic

The new `updatePosition()` method:

1. **Forward Movement**: Uses `getNextValidProgress()` to find the next valid position
2. **Current Position**: Allows staying near current position for small adjustments
3. **Backward Correction**: Allows small backward movement (2%) for corrections only
4. **Failure Detection**: Triggers failure if cursor is off-path for too long

### 4. Stricter Configuration

Default settings are now more restrictive:

```typescript
{
  tolerance: 40,              // Reduced from 60px - must be closer to path
  maxBackwardMovement: 0.02,  // Reduced from 0.05 - less correction allowed
  failureTimeoutMs: 200,      // Reduced from 300ms - faster failure
}
```

## How It Works

### Before (Exploitable)
```
Path: A → B → C → D → E
User could: A ────────────→ E (direct line)
Result: ✅ Completed (incorrectly)
```

### After (Sequential)
```
Path: A → B → C → D → E
User must: A → B → C → D → E (follow each segment)
Direct jump: A ────────────→ E
Result: ❌ Failed (cursor off path)
```

### Example: Zigzag Pattern

**Old System:**
- User could drag straight from start to end
- System would find "closest point" which was the end
- Path completed without following zigzag

**New System:**
- User must follow each zigzag segment
- Can only advance 3% of path at a time
- Must stay within 40px of the correct path segment
- Cannot skip to later segments

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Cheating**: No more shortcuts or direct lines to finish
2. **Enforces Skill**: Users must demonstrate actual path-following ability
3. **Fair Difficulty**: All path types now have consistent difficulty
4. **Better UX**: Clear feedback when user goes off-path
5. **Configurable**: Can adjust strictness per button if needed

## Testing

Test with different path types to verify sequential movement:

```typescript
// All of these now require following the complete path
this.dragButtonManager.createSimpleButton('zigzag', 200, 200, PathType.ZIGZAG, 80, 1);
this.dragButtonManager.createSimpleButton('heart', 400, 200, PathType.HEART, 80, 1);
this.dragButtonManager.createSimpleButton('spiral', 600, 200, PathType.SPIRAL, 80, 1);
this.dragButtonManager.createSimpleButton('circle', 300, 400, PathType.CIRCLE, 80, 1);
```

## Customization

For different difficulty levels:

```typescript
// Easy mode (more forgiving)
buttonConfig: {
  tolerance: 60,
  maxBackwardMovement: 0.05,
  failureTimeoutMs: 400,
}

// Hard mode (very strict)
buttonConfig: {
  tolerance: 25,
  maxBackwardMovement: 0.01,
  failureTimeoutMs: 100,
}
```

The system now ensures that users must demonstrate genuine path-following skills rather than finding shortcuts!
